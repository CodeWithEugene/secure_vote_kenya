# Online Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Description
The Online Blockchain-Based Voting System is a decentralized, transparent, and secure voting platform designed to combat vote theft in Kenya. This system leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of elections by providing a tamper-proof ledger, automated vote tallying through smart contracts, and real-time verification of results.

## Features
- **Decentralized Ledger**: Ensures all votes are recorded on a distributed blockchain ledger to prevent manipulation.
- **Automated Vote Tallying**: Uses smart contracts to automatically count and verify votes without human intervention.
- **Biometric Voter Authentication**: Integrates biometric data and blockchain-based identification to ensure secure voter identification.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Allows voters and election observers to verify results in real-time through a public dashboard.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Employs cryptographic encryption to protect voter identities and ballot integrity.

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js for the user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum for smart contracts.
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS for secure storage of voter biometric data.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CodeWithEugene/secure_vote_kenya.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd secure_vote_kenya
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. Access the application via your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing
The project includes various tests to ensure reliability and performance:
- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual components.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure seamless interaction between the frontend and blockchain.
- **Performance Tests**: Handle high traffic with a target of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS).

## Future Improvements
- **Cross-Border Voting Support**: Enable voting for diaspora voters.
- **AI-Driven Fraud Detection**: Implement machine learning algorithms to detect potential fraud.
- **Blockchain Network Optimization**: Improve scalability to handle higher voter traffic.
